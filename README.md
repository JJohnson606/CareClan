# Overview

CareClan is a web application designed to streamline the management and sharing of medical care responsibilities within families. The platform enables users to efficiently communicate updates, make collective decisions, and maintain a centralized record of their elderly family member's care.

**Addressing Care Coordination Challenges**

> In our fast-paced and often dispersed world, coordinating care for family members presents a unique set of challenges. Families are frequently spread across different locations, > making it difficult to stay informed about the daily care and medical updates of their loved ones. Given the sensitive nature of healthcare, there's a critical need for a tool
